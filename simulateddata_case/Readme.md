To test the validity of the MCMC sampling scheme, we applied it to simulated datasets that were similar into structure to the bird data, but generated with known parameter values. You can find in this folder the code to create the datasets with diferent number of species and movement steps, as well as the code to fit the JSMM to the simulated data: https://github.com/LEEClab/JSMM/blob/master/simulateddata_case/simulatedDataset-generate_and_fit.R .
